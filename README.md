# Weather app

## Steps to run on local

- `npm i` Install dependencies (suggested node version 20.9)
- Update the .env.development file with your API key

## **Problem Statement**

Create a Simple Weather Dashboard

## **Objective**

Develop a small web application that displays weather information for a user-selected city. This task primarily evaluates your ability to work with APIs, UI design, and React components.

## **Evaluation Criteria**

- Functionality: Does the application work as expected?
- UI Design: Is the UI user-friendly and visually appealing?
- Responsiveness: Does the layout adapt well to different screen sizes?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured and clean?

## **Requirements**

1. **Framework**: The application should be built using **React**.
2. **API Integration**: Use a free weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data.
3. **User Interface**: The application should have an input field to enter a city name and a submit button.
4. **Display**: On submission, display the current weather information of the se4. selected city, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, etc.).
5. **Storage**: Use **local storage** to remember the last searched city and its weather information, displaying it when the user revisits the app.
6. **Responsiveness**: The application should be responsive and provide a good layout on both mobile and desktop screens.
7. **Error Handling**: Include basic error handling for scenarios like invalid city names or API failures.

## Bonus

- Add icons or images representing the current weather condition.
- Implement a loading state while the weather data is being fetched.

## **Output**

1. URL of the live app (can be hosted on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)
2. Source code hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

**Note:** While the focus is on frontend skills, good practices in code organization and readability will also be considered.
